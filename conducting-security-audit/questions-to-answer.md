## Part 1

### Question: What are the biggest risks to the organization?

- Inadequate Management of Assets: Without effective asset management, we cannot fully understand the impact or scope of potential threats. This can significantly hamper our ability to respond to incidents in a timely and effective manner.
- Lack of Proper Controls: This puts our systems and data at risk of compromise from various cyber threats, making it one of the largest areas of risk for the company.
- Non-Compliance with Regulations: Non-compliance can lead to significant financial and reputational damage due to potential penalties and a loss of trust among customers and partners.

### Question: Which controls are most essential to implement immediately versus in the future?

Immediate:

- **Asset Management System:** A robust system for managing assets will provide visibility and control, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.
- **Access Controls:** Implementation of the principle of least privilege (PoLP) across systems and services can significantly reduce the attack surface.

Future:

- **Continuous Monitoring:** Establishing regular monitoring and auditing processes will help detect and address issues before they become significant risks.

- **Incident Response Plan:** While this might not be an immediate requirement, having a plan in place will ensure that we can respond effectively to any security incidents that do occur.

### Which compliance regulations does Botium Toys need to adhere to, to ensure the company keeps customer and vendor data safe, avoids fines, etc.?

- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): If we have customers in the European Union.
- California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA): If we have customers in California.
- Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS): If we handle credit card transactions.
- Childrenâ€™s Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA): If we offer online services directed towards children under 13 or knowingly collect data from children under 13.

These are just few possibilities. We should conduct a comprehensive review of our operations to identify all applicable regulations.
